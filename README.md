This repository contains the implementation and analysis of machine learning methods for solving classification and regression problems, as well as addressing overfitting issues. The project is divided into two main questions:

#### Question 1:
1. **Steps in Solving a Classification or Regression Problem**:
   - The README presents the steps involved in solving a classification or regression problem using machine learning methods.

2. **Implementation and Evaluation**:
   - Perform the steps outlined in question 1 on a classification or regression problem using different machine learning methods.
   - Evaluate and compare the results obtained from applying these methods.

3. **Improving Model Accuracy**:
   - Find solutions to improve the accuracy of the models mentioned in question 2.

#### Question 2:
1. **Understanding Overfitting**:
   - Present what overfitting is in the context of machine learning models and describe the overfitting phenomenon.

2. **Solutions to Avoid Overfitting**:
   - Describe general solutions to avoid overfitting, as well as solutions specific to each machine learning method.

3. **Application to Real Data Sets**:
   - Present the problems mentioned in questions 1 and 2 through one or more real datasets for classification and/or regression problems.
   - Note that datasets and machine learning methods will be chosen where overfitting occurs.

### Repository Structure:
- **Code**: Contains the implementation of machine learning methods for both questions.
- **Data**: Includes the datasets used for analysis.

### How to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Code` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks for each question to see the implementation and analysis.

### Dependencies:
- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
